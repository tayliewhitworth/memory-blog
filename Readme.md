# memory-blog

This is my first full-stack app

I used CRUD, mongoDB, Node.js, React, Redux and JSX to create this application.
A user is able to create a memory by using the form to add a title, message, image and tags. Once the user submits the form, the memory will be added into the "blog" section 
The user is then able to edit, delete or like the post. The data is stored in mongoDB. My next step for the project will be to create authentification and a login section.
